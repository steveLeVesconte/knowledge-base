Edit

This is actually a brilliant study strategy that aligns with how experienced developers learn best. You're designing a **project-driven learning approach** rather than the typical **certification-driven cramming**.

## Why This Approach Is Superior

**Memory vs. Understanding:**

- Memorizing "Azure Functions support triggers X, Y, Z" fades quickly
- Building a function that actually responds to Service Bus messages creates lasting knowledge
- You'll remember the gotchas, limitations, and real-world patterns

**Context Over Isolation:**

- AZ-204 topics make more sense when they solve actual problems in your project
- You'll understand why you need distributed caching, not just how to configure it
- Integration patterns become obvious rather than abstract

**Portfolio Building:**

- Every AZ-204 concept you implement becomes a demonstration of competency
- Your project tells a coherent story rather than disconnected examples
- Interview conversations become: "Let me show you how I implemented this..."

## AZ-204 Topics That Fit Naturally

**Your Phase 0-2 will likely cover:**

- Azure App Service (deployment target)
- Azure SQL Database (data layer)
- Application Insights (monitoring)
- Azure Key Vault (secrets management)
- Azure DevOps/GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- ARM templates/Bicep (Infrastructure as Code)

**Later phases naturally introduce:**

- Azure Functions (microservices extraction)
- Service Bus (inter-service messaging)
- Cosmos DB (modern data patterns)
- Azure Container Instances/AKS (containerization)
- API Management (gateway patterns)
- Azure Storage (blob/queue storage)

## The Coverage Gap Strategy

**What you'll miss:**

- Cognitive Services integrations
- Event Grid patterns
- Some Azure Functions triggers
- Specific API Management policies
- Certain storage account configurations

**Gap-filling approach:**

1. **Month 1-2**: Build your project, document what AZ-204 topics you encounter
2. **Month 3**: Take practice exams to identify coverage gaps
3. **Month 4**: Quick-hit learning for missed topics, then back to project integration
4. **Month 5**: Final exam prep with your project as the foundation

## Project-First Learning Benefits

**Real Problem Solving:**

- "I need authentication" → Research Azure AD integration
- "Deployment is manual" → Learn ARM templates/Bicep
- "No visibility into performance" → Implement Application Insights

**Natural Progression:**

- Each phase solves a real problem your previous phase created
- Learning feels necessary rather than arbitrary
- Concepts build on each other logically

**Interview Readiness:**

- You can demo actual working solutions
- You understand the why, not just the what
- You have war stories about trade-offs and decisions

## Practical Implementation

**Week 1**: Set up basic app, Azure App Service, deployment pipeline **Week 2**: Add Azure SQL Database, connection strings in Key Vault **Week 3**: Implement Application Insights, logging patterns **Week 4**: Add authentication with Azure AD **Week 5-8**: Continue through phases as problems arise

**Documentation Strategy:**

- Document each AZ-204 topic as you encounter it
- Note real-world gotchas and limitations
- Create a mapping: "Phase X implements AZ-204 topics Y, Z"

This approach demonstrates something crucial: **you can learn new technologies systematically and apply them to solve real problems**. That's exactly what employers want to see, and it's much more convincing than a certificate alone.

The risk of missing some AZ-204 topics is far outweighed by the depth of understanding you'll gain in the topics you do cover. Plus, your project becomes a living demonstration of your capabilities.
