***THIS PROMPT INAVERTANTLY CHANGED AFTER USE.***

I'm working on a .NET Framework to .NET 9 migration project outline. Please review the following sections for **terminology improvements**:

- Phase 5: Modern Authentication & OAuth Implementation
- Phase 7: Scalability Patterns

**Focus areas for terminology review:**

1. **Migration methodology terms** - Are phrases like "migration story," "migration readiness checklist," "functional parity" the standard terms used in platform migration contexts?
2. **Azure deployment concepts** - Review terminology around App Service, SQL Database, Infrastructure as Code (Bicep), secrets management, deployment pipelines
3. **Testing & baseline terminology** - Are terms like "smoke testing," "performance baselines," "load testing baseline," "cold start performance" used correctly and precisely?
4. **Performance measurement terms** - Review phrases describing metrics, benchmarking, comparison analysis
5. **General software engineering terms** - Look for places where I might be using informal or imprecise terminology where industry-standard terms exist

**What I'm looking for:**

- Industry-standard terminology I should adopt
- More precise technical terms where I've been vague
- Corrections where I've misused terms
- Consistency improvements across these phases

**Context**: I'm a 40+ year developer (strong in MVC, SQL, C#) but learning modern .NET Core, Azure, and IaC patterns. Sometimes I'm guessing at the correct terminology.

Please highlight specific improvements with brief explanations of why the suggested term is more appropriate.

This is a stepwise ai prompting process.  I have completed this process for sections 0 through 5.  This prompt is about sections 6 and 7.  Later prompts will deal with the remaining sections 8-10 and later material
