Some item I can resolve:
 **Phase Numbering Gap**
AI Task: remove extra hashmarks from phase 4


 **Authentication Testing Scope Ambiguity**
AI Task: remove "LOCAL ONLY" FROM Phase 3

**Database Architecture Contradiction**

In phase 4, the identity database will be replaced with "External authentication provider integration", 

AI Task: if this is not clear, make it more clear.

AI Task: please update it to be more clear.  (or should it be deleted?)
