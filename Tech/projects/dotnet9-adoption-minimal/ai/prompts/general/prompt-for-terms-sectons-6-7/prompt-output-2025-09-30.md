## Legend

- **âœ… CORE** - Essential for learning objectives and portfolio demonstration
- **ðŸ”¶ OPTIONAL** - Valuable for production but not required for learning/portfolio
- **[DELAYABLE to Phase X]** - Better suited for a later phase (e.g., Kubernetes features in Phase 9)
- **[OPTIONAL]** - Can skip if time-constrained; evaluate value vs. effort

## Decision Framework

**When deciding whether to implement OPTIONAL items:**

1. **Time constraint**: If behind schedule, skip all OPTIONAL items
2. **Learning goals**: If a pattern teaches AZ-204 concepts, prioritize it
3. **Portfolio value**: If it demonstrates production-readiness thinking, consider it
4. **Dependencies**: If Phase 8/9/10 needs it, do it; otherwise defer
5. **Complexity**: If adding an OPTIONAL item doubles implementation time, skip it

**Recommended minimum path** (for time-constrained scenario):

- Skip all items marked OPTIONAL
- Implement all CORE items
- Revisit OPTIONAL items in a "Phase 6.5" / "Phase 7.5" if productionizing later
