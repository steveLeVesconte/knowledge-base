context: 
71-year-old software dev
30+ years exp: including SQL, Web, MVC, CSS, HTML, C#, XML, 
Learning: az-204, Core, Cloud, prompt engineering
3 years off for learning sabbatical -> to learn new skills

Working on a Legacy Modernization Project for both leaning potential and hopefully GitHub curb appeal.

The attached document project-outline.md represents my project.



AI Question: I like keeping the references to az-204 in the doc for my own use, but should I make a "public copy" for the GitHub repository where those references are removed?  Do they help or hurt my gravitas?
