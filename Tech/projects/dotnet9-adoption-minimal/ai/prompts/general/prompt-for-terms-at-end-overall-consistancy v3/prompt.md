I'm working on a .NET Framework to .NET 9 migration project outline. "merged-result-due-to-ai-hickup.md". This has been a stepwise prompt driven rewrite and so, there may have been inconsistencies introduced.

Specifically, Claude abended in Phase 10 during a rewrite that introduced small changes.


Please review the merged-result-due-to-ai-hickup.md Phase 10 and later for  inconsistencies and technical contradictions with the sections above.
