#Context: 40yrs+ Software Dev (MVC, SQL, C#, JS/HTML/CSS),
- learning (.NET Core and Azure and IaC and Prompt Engineering)

I have this document for my current showcase project: project-outline-v5.md (attached)

In a recent prompt response, I saw that Claude was choosing better terminology than I was using.  Sometimes I am guessing about the correct terminology for a concept.

#Example Claud output with good terminology:

Here's what you accomplished in Phase 0:

1. **Selected a real legacy project** (not trivialâ€”had to assess complexity, risks, modernization potential)
2. **Researched and understood** a 10-phase, multi-year migration pathway
3. **Designed a sophisticated branching strategy** with sub-branches and merge patterns
4. **Created comprehensive documentation standards** (5 different doc types with clear purposes)
5. **Established project governance** (repository policies, contribution guidelines)
6. **Identified specific risks** (browser compatibility, Phase 4 breaking changes)
7. **Made architectural decisions** (testing strategy, IaC approach, monitoring)



#AI Task:
Suggest a prompt strategy to improve the document project-outline-v5.md.

Should I make one prompt like "review this document and make terminology improvements" as one prompt?  Or would I get better results by asking for smaller chunks such as phases 0-4?

If I should chunk, give a size of chunk.
