I'm working on a .NET Framework 4.6.1 to .NET 9 migration project (MVC Music Store).   The project has 2 overall purposes:
- learn concepts related to az-204
- create a portfolio project demonstrating how to migrate a legacy project

Context documents:
- initial-project-outline.md 
- base-project-context.md (current app details)
- various source files - see attached


I have made a few changes to "project-outline-v3.md"
All changes are marked with "(recent change)" or "(broken check-in likely)"

# AI Task: evaluate the project-outline-v3.md for consistency and likelihood of success.  If needed, amend project-outline-v3.md or suggest amendments, especially focusing on the changes.
