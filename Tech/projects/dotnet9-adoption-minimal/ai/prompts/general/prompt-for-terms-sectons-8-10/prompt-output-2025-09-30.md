## Phase 8: API-First Architecture & Integration Patterns

**Branch Strategy**: `phase-8-api-modernization` with sub-branches:

- `phase-8b-api-management` - Azure API Management integration
- `phase-8c-async-messaging` - Azure Service Bus for background processing

**Version**: `v6.0.0` _(major feature - API layer introduction)_

**AZ-204 Skills**: Web API development, Azure API Management, Azure Service Bus, background workers

**Completion Criteria**:

- [ ]  RESTful API operational alongside MVC application
- [ ]  API Management policies configured (rate limiting, caching)
- [ ]  Asynchronous order processing with Service Bus
- [ ]  API versioning strategy implemented
- [ ]  Distributed tracing across API and MVC components

**Regional Bank Context**:

Separate the data access layer into a dedicated API to enable future mobile app development, third-party integrations (payment gateways), and internal admin tools as separate clients. This is the natural first step in architectural evolution - providing an API layer without the complexity of full microservices decomposition.

**Tasks**:

    - ASP.NET Core Web API project (separate from MVC)
    - RESTful endpoint design (albums, artists, genres, orders)
    - OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation

    - Shared data access layer between MVC and API projects
    - DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for API responses
- **Azure API Management integration** âœ… CORE
    - APIM instance provisioning (Consumption or Basic tier)
    - API import and registration via OpenAPI specification
    - Rate limiting policies (protect against abuse)

    - Circuit breaker pattern (Polly) for API call resilience
    - Timeout policies for API requests
    - Response caching in MVC layer (reduce API calls)
- **Cross-cutting concerns** âœ… CORE
    - Correlation ID propagation (MVC â†’ API â†’ Service Bus â†’ Worker)
    - Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry (spans across components)
    - Structured logging with context (user ID, order ID, correlation ID)
    - Error handling with Problem Details (RFC 7807) in API
- **Database access patterns** âœ… CORE
    - API and MVC share same database (no data duplication yet)
    - Connection string management via Azure Key Vault
    - Connection pooling configuration for multiple clients
    - **[OPTIONAL]** Read replicas for scaling read operations
