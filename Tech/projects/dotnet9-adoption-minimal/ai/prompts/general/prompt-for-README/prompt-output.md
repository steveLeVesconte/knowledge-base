# Legacy to Modern .NET Migration

A comprehensive migration journey from .NET Framework 4.6.1 to .NET 9, transforming a legacy MVC Music Store application into a cloud-native architecture on Azure.

## üéØ Project Purpose

This project serves as both a practical learning exercise for Azure development (AZ-204) and a portfolio demonstration of enterprise-grade application modernization. It documents the complete migration path from a traditional ASP.NET MVC application to a modern, containerized, cloud-native solution‚Äîpreserving full functionality while progressively enhancing architecture, performance, and scalability.

**Why this matters:** Organizations worldwide face similar challenges migrating legacy .NET Framework applications. This project provides a reusable methodology, real-world problem-solving, and quantifiable outcomes that transfer directly to production modernization efforts.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Evolution

### Starting Point (Legacy)
- .NET Framework 4.6.1 + ASP.NET MVC 5
- Entity Framework 6.2.0 with LocalDB
- ASP.NET Identity 2.2.2
- OWIN middleware pipeline
- Single-instance in-memory session state
- Manual deployment

### Target Architecture (Modern)
- .NET 9 + ASP.NET Core MVC
- Entity Framework Core with Azure SQL Database
- ASP.NET Core Identity + External OAuth (Microsoft, Google)
- Azure Container Apps with auto-scaling
- Distributed session state (Azure Cache for Redis)
- Azure Service Bus for async processing
- Azure API Management for RESTful APIs
- OpenTelemetry + Application Insights observability
- Infrastructure as Code (Bicep)
- Multi-stage CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

## üìä Migration Phases

| Phase | Focus | Key Deliverables |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| **Phase 0** | Planning | Repository structure, branching strategy, documentation framework |
| **Phase 1** | Foundation | Test coverage (xUnit), Application Insights, local performance baselines |
| **Phase 2** | Azure Migration | Azure SQL Database, App Service deployment, CI/CD pipeline, IaC (Bicep) |
| **Phase 3** | Azure Validation | Smoke testing, performance benchmarking, load testing, environment analysis |
| **Phase 4** | Platform Migration | .NET 9 conversion, EF Core migration, ASP.NET Core Identity, middleware pipeline |
| **Phase 5** | Modern Auth | OAuth 2.0/PKCE, external identity providers, Azure Key Vault secrets |
| **Phase 6** | Observability | OpenTelemetry tracing, structured logging, APM dashboards, health checks |
| **Phase 7** | Scalability | Distributed caching, async I/O, connection pooling, resilience patterns |
| **Phase 8** | API-First | RESTful Web API, API Management, Service Bus integration, distributed tracing |
| **Phase 9** | Cloud Native | Docker containers, Azure Container Registry, Container Apps, managed identity |
| **Phase 10** | DevOps Excellence | Multi-stage pipelines, security scanning (SAST/SCA), DORA metrics, compliance |
