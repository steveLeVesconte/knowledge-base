I'm working on a .NET Framework to .NET 9 migration project.

I need README.md for the GitHub repository.


Documents in root of project:
09/28/2025  01:31 PM             9,557 CONTRIBUTING.md
09/25/2025  07:01 AM             2,810 ORIGINAL_README.md from the original dnkato/MvcMusicStore gitHub repo
09/28/2025  01:02 PM             8,302 PROJECT-LOG.md
09/30/2025  01:28 PM            41,741 project-outline.md
09/27/2025  11:57 AM               261 README.md   (to be replaced by this prompt)

Attached source document: condensed-from-project-outline.md


project decisions:
- legacy project: dnkato/MvcMusicStore
    - Tutorial repo specifically states it was "coded using Visual Studio 2017
    - ASP.NET 4.6.1
    - MVC version 5.2.4.0
- repository name: legacy-to-modern-dotnet-migration
    - note: a later project may be named "dotnet9-adoption-at-scale"
- conversion methodology: Microsoft Migration Tools

## Success Metrics (Updated)

### **Phase-Specific Measurable Outcomes**

|Phase|Performance Metrics|Quality Metrics|
|---|---|---|
|**Phase 1**|Local baseline times|Test coverage %|
|**Phase 3**|Azure vs local comparison|Uptime %|
|**Phase 4**|.NET 9 performance gains|Migration success %|
|**Phase 5**|OAuth response times|Security scan results|
|**Phase 6**|Monitoring coverage|MTTR improvements|
|**Phase 7**|Cache hit ratios|Scalability metrics|
|**Phase 8**|API/Service Bus latency|Distributed tracing coverage|
|**Phase 9**|Container Apps performance|Container security score|
|**Phase 10**|DORA metrics (deployment frequency, lead time)|Security gate pass rate|

### **Overall Project Success Criteria**

- [ ] Complete functional parity maintained throughout all phases
- [ ] Measurable performance improvements documented (local → Azure → Container Apps)
- [ ] Zero data loss during all migrations (database, identity, session state)
- [ ] All security scans passed with no high/critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Comprehensive migration playbook produced for others to follow
- [ ] AZ-204 exam skills demonstrated and documented across all phases
