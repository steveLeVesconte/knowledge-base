Context: 40yrs+ Software Dev (MVC, SQL, C#, JS/HTML/CSS),
- learning (.NET Core and Azure and IaC)

Purpose and Priorities of Project:
- For the audience of possible employers and their agents, show a chops as a valuable software developer.
- Serve as a learning lab for AZ-204
- improve .NET Core skills both for doting the work and performing in job interviews
- practice Prompt Engineering skills, step by step as I proceed through the project.

Three sequential tasks for AI:
1. Identify any contradictions these changes create in the document
2. Rewrite sections for consistency (provide updated sections only)
3. Assess if the revised plan appears workable

Priority documents:
- project-outline-v4.md (my current plan)
- base-project-context.md (app details)
- Startup.Auth.cs (shows OAuth is commented out)
  
  
  
AI Task: evaluate and comment on the following question:

Does phase 2 belong where it is in project-outline-v4.md?  Should it be later in the sequence?  What is the value of promoting the legacy app to Azure before the update to .NET9?  I kind of want to do it as is, but I am not sure I can defend the reason why.
