# README Context Summary

## Project Overview

This project documents a comprehensive migration of a legacy .NET Framework 4.6.1 MVC Music Store application to a modern .NET 9 cloud-native architecture deployed on Azure. The migration serves dual purposes: demonstrating practical skills for the AZ-204 Azure Developer certification while creating a portfolio piece that showcases enterprise-grade application modernization.

The Music Store is an e-commerce application featuring user authentication, role-based authorization (Admin/Visitor), shopping cart functionality, and catalog management. The migration preserves complete functional parity throughout all phases while progressively modernizing the architecture, infrastructure, and deployment model. The project emphasizes measurable outcomes with comprehensive performance baselines captured at each phase to quantify improvements from local development through Azure App Service and ultimately to containerized deployment on Azure Container Apps.

This migration addresses real-world challenges including ASP.NET Identity 2.2.2 schema preservation, Entity Framework 6 to EF Core conversion with existing data, OWIN to ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline transformation, and session state management for multi-instance deployment scenarios.

## Technical Stack

**Current State:**

- In-memory session state (single instance only)
- jQuery 3.3.1, Bootstrap 3.4.1, Modernizr 2.8.3

**Target State:**

- .NET 9 with ASP.NET Core MVC
- Entity Framework Core with Azure SQL Database
- ASP.NET Core Identity with external OAuth providers (Microsoft Identity Platform, Google)
- ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline
- Distributed session state with Azure Cache for Redis
- Azure Container Apps deployment with auto-scaling
- Azure Service Bus for asynchronous message processing
- Azure API Management for RESTful API layer
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation with Azure Monitor/Application Insights
- Infrastructure as Code using Bicep templates
- Multi-stage CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Migration Phases

1. **Phase 0: Planning** - Project scoping, documentation structure, repository setup, and branching strategy definition
2. **Phase 1: Foundation & Local Baselines** - Test coverage expansion (xUnit), Application Insights instrumentation, comprehensive performance baseline capture
3. **Phase 2: Azure Migration & Deployment** - LocalDB to Azure SQL Database migration, Azure App Service deployment, CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, Infrastructure as Code (Bicep)

6. **Phase 5: Modern Authentication & External Identity Providers** - Microsoft Identity Platform integration, Google OAuth 2.0, account linking, PKCE security implementation, Azure Key Vault for secrets
7. **Phase 6: Observability & Instrumentation** - OpenTelemetry distributed tracing, structured logging, Application Performance Monitoring dashboards, business telemetry, health check endpoints
8. **Phase 7: Horizontal Scalability Patterns** - Azure Cache for Redis, distributed session state, asynchronous I/O patterns, connection pool optimization, resilience patterns with circuit breakers
9. **Phase 8: API-First Architecture & Integration Patterns** - RESTful Web API extraction, Azure API Management integration, Azure Service Bus for background processing, distributed tracing across components
10. **Phase 9: Cloud Native Transformation (Azure Container Apps)** - Docker containerization, Azure Container Registry, Container Apps deployment, auto-scaling, managed identity for secrets, zero-downtime deployments
11. **Phase 10: DevOps Excellence & Production Readiness** - Multi-stage CI/CD pipelines, automated quality gates, security scanning (SAST/SCA), compliance automation, DORA metrics capture

- **Security Hardening**: OAuth 2.0 with PKCE, managed identities, Azure Key Vault integration, automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- **Production-Grade Observability**: OpenTelemetry distributed tracing, structured logging, business metrics instrumentation, APM dashboards
- **Enterprise DevOps Practices**: Infrastructure as Code, multi-environment pipelines, automated quality gates, audit trail automation, rollback procedures
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Distributed caching, stateless architecture, auto-scaling validation, load testing scenarios

## Value Proposition

This project demonstrates the complete journey from legacy monolithic application to modern cloud-native architecture, addressing challenges that organizations face when modernizing their application portfolio. The migration methodology is transferable to other legacy .NET Framework applications, providing a reusable pattern for platform upgrades and cloud adoption.

For employers, this showcases practical Azure development skills aligned with AZ-204 certification objectives, modern software engineering practices (CI/CD, IaC, observability), and the ability to balance technical excellence with pragmatic delivery. The comprehensive documentation and performance analysis demonstrate analytical thinking and communication skills essential for senior development roles.

For learners, the project provides a real-world reference implementation with detailed decision rationale, troubleshooting guidance, and lessons learned at each phase. The progressive complexity allows following the migration incrementally while understanding the architectural evolution from traditional three-tier application to API-first, containerized, event-driven architecture.
