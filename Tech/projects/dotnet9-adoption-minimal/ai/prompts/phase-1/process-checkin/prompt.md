# Review and analyze project process decisions

## Primary Focus (what TO do):
- Review and analyze project process decisions as described and practiced in:

  CONTRIBUTING.md
  KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md
  PARKING-LOT.md
  PROJECT-LOG.md

  view-migrartion-tasks.md


  Judge them as process for completing the project described in: project-outline.md

  - too much?
  - appear professional?
  - useful vs. fluff or friction?
  - well coordinated vs. scattered
  - complete vs. not-compete

## Persona

- As a Lead Developer coaching a junior developer



## Success Criteria (done when):
â–¡ Junior Developer has clear plan to proceed with project process and methods


## Context Priority:
PRIMARY: 

Software Development Project has 2 main goals:

- Present well as a GitHub Project for hiring managers.
- A learning tool:
  - industry practice for project disapplies
  - az-204
  - prompt engineering (secondary)

- project-outline.md
- PROJECT-LOG.md
- PARKING-LOG.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- view-migration-tasks.md [.docs/phase-4]

SECONDARY: I have been developing these process decisions at the start of this project bit by bit.  Now I want to view them as a hole.  Are they workable and presentable?

Example: I decided not to include daily planning and daily accomplishments in PROJECT-LOG.md.  It just felt like too much friction.  I do not think I would do it.
