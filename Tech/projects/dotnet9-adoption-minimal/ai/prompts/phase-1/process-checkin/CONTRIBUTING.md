- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Include XML documentation for public APIs
- Prefer explicit over implicit when it improves readability

### Documentation Style
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Structure with proper headings and navigation
- Reference specific file names and line numbers when relevant

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): brief description

Longer explanation if needed. Reference issues with #123.

- List specific changes
- Include performance impacts
- Note any breaking changes
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests** - Individual component functionality
2. **Integration Tests** - Multi-component interactions
3. **Performance Tests** - Baseline and regression testing
4. **Migration Tests** - Verify migration step success

### Test Naming Convention
```csharp
[TestMethod]
public void MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior()
{
    // Arrange
    // Act  
    // Assert
}
```

### Performance Test Requirements
- Include baseline measurements
- Use consistent test environments
- Document test methodology
- Compare results across phases

## üìä Performance Contribution Guidelines

### Benchmark Standards
- Run tests multiple times for consistency
- Document hardware/environment specifications
- Use standardized test scenarios
- Include statistical analysis (mean, median, std dev)

### Performance Improvement PRs
Must include:
- Before/after metrics with statistical significance
- Description of optimization approach
- Impact analysis on other system components
- Regression test coverage

## üîí Security Considerations

### Security Contributions
- Follow OWASP guidelines for web applications
- Document security implications of changes
- Include security testing for auth-related changes
- Use Azure security best practices

### Sensitive Information
- **Never commit** connection strings, API keys, or secrets
- Use placeholder values in documentation
- Reference Azure Key Vault for production secrets
- Sanitize any log outputs in examples


## Scope Control Policy

**No new features or enhancements before Phase 5 completion.**

All work through Phase 5 focuses exclusively on:
- Platform migration (.NET Framework ‚Üí .NET 9)
- Cloud deployment (Azure infrastructure)
- Authentication modernization (external identity providers)
- Scalability patterns (distributed cache, async I/O)
- Observability (monitoring and instrumentation)

Feature requests, UI improvements, and capability expansions are deferred to:
- **Phase 5a** (if approved after Phase 5 retrospective)
- **Post-migration backlog** (separate project)

This scope discipline protects migration timeline, reduces risk of regression, and maintains focus on primary objective: successful platform modernization with functional parity.

### How to Handle Discovered Limitations

When you identify potential improvements during migration work:
1. Document in `KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md`in project root.
2. Classify as "Out of Scope" with rationale
3. Add to post-migration backlog only after Phase 5 complete


## üöÄ Release Process

This project follows semantic versioning aligned with migration phases:
- **Major versions** (v2.0.0) - Complete migration phases
- **Minor versions** (v1.1.0) - Significant features within a phase  
- **Patch versions** (v1.0.1) - Bug fixes and small improvements

### Phase Release Criteria
Each phase must include:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented
- [ ] Migration guide updated
- [ ] Lessons learned documented
- [ ] Next phase prerequisites identified
