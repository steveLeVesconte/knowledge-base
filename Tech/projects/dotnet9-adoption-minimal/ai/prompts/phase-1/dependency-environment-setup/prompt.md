# Task Description: Draft complete `environment-setup.md` 

## Contingency:  If context documents are not sufficient to create a dependency-inventory.md - list missing context and abort.

## Persona: as  primary developer

## Primary Focus (what TO do):
- create a environment-setup.md document consistent with "environment-setup.md" - professional in appearance and technically complete.

## Boundaries (what NOT to do):
- go overboard - suggest too much.  We want respectable process - not extreme DOD process.

## Success Criteria (done when):
â–¡ environment-setup.md fulfils implied promises of work-breakout.md

Note: treat the context files as "offerings" (not controlling signals) as the developer does not know what context you need to do this job.
## Context Priority:
PRIMARY: - 
- Developers assertions:
	- solution has been cloned and committed to new repository **[legacy-to-modern-dotnet-migration](https://github.com/steveLeVesconte/legacy-to-modern-dotnet-migration)**
	- new repository cloned to local PC
	- NuGet packages have been restored (not update)
	- build succeeds
	- debug run succeeds
	- Initial shallow smoke test passed - visiting public pages - no crashes.
