# Task Description: Plan Next Developer Task

## Persona: as if you were a lead .NET developer planning work for a junior developer

## Primary Focus (what TO do):
- plan the work for Phase 1: Foundation & Local Baselines at a high level.
 -- include names of any artifacts that would be expected to be produced in an enterprise project to document work done.
 -- include a folder structure to store such documents in the GitHub repository
 -- include suggested notes to be placed in project-log
 -- if useful, include templates for suggested documentation

## Boundaries (what NOT to do):
- go overboard - suggest too much.  We want respectable process - not extreme DOD process.

## Success Criteria (done when):
â–¡ the plan (the output from this prompt) allows junior developer to get to work with confidence that he working on the right task and producing the right documentation.


## Context Priority:
PRIMARY: 
  - assume that "Phase 0: Planning" is complete
  - subset-of-project-outline-in-focus.md
  - file-tree-partial.md
        
SECONDARY: - project-outline.md - for general context only
