## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Session Management
- [x] Session maintains across page navigation ‚úÖ PASS
- [x] Session timeout works (default 20 min, sliding expiration) ‚ö†Ô∏è PASS (not exhaustively tested)
- [x] Session expires on logout ‚ùå FAIL (expected behavior, but problematic for cart)

### Error Handling
- [x] Navigate to non-existent page (`/DoesNotExist`) - appropriate 404
- [x] Intentionally trigger server error - custom error page (not YSOD) ‚úÖ

**Result**: PASS - custom error configuration works correctly in both dev and production modes.
Test exception code removed after verification.

### Security Verification
- [x] Anonymous user cannot access `/StoreManager` - redirects to login
- [x] Visitor user cannot access `/StoreManager` ‚ùå SAME BUG AS ADMIN

**Finding**: Both Admin and Visitor roles exhibit same behavior - redirect to login 
instead of proper authorization check. This is the authorization bug discovered during 
admin testing (see PROJECT-LOG.md investigation).

**Workaround**: Access `/StoreManager` while not logged in, then login from redirect.

### Anti-Forgery Token Verification
- [x] View source on Register form - `__RequestVerificationToken` present
- [x] Token has long random value (100+ chars, base64-encoded)
- [x] Token changes on page refresh (not static)
- [x] Checked 3 other forms (Login, Album Create, Checkout) - all have tokens
- [x] Cookie `__RequestVerificationToken` present in browser

**Result**: ‚úÖ PASS - CSRF protection active via ASP.NET MVC anti-forgery tokens

### HTTPS Enforcement
- [DEFERRED] HTTPS enforced (if configured)

**Configuration Status**: NOT CONFIGURED for local development

**Deferral Decision**: 
- HTTPS configuration deferred to **Phase 2a** (Azure deployment requirement)
- Local Phase 1 testing proceeds over HTTP only
- No local HTTPS testing attempted in Phase 1

**Risk Assessment**: 
- **Risk**: Late discovery of HTTPS-specific issues (cookies, OWIN auth, mixed content)
- **Likelihood**: Medium - HTTPS can expose cookie/auth issues not visible over HTTP
- **Impact**: High - Could block Phase 2 Azure deployment if critical issues found
- **Mitigation**: Phase 2a begins with dedicated HTTPS smoke test before database migration

**Rationale**: 
- Initial attempt to configue HTTPS blocked smoke testing.  Remediaton attemps lasted more than an hour.  Fixing this is not a smoke test concern. - document and move on.


### Validation (Basic Smoke Test)

**Client-Side Validation**
- [x] Register form: Submit with empty email - validation message displays before server request
- [x] Register form: Submit with invalid email format - validation message displays

### üß™ Server-Side Validation Smoke Test (bypass client-side validation)

- [x] Disable JavaScript in Chrome (DevTools ‚Üí Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí ‚ÄúDisable JavaScript‚Äù)
- [x] Open **Register** form
- [x] Submit with empty required fields
- [x] Observe full page reload (POST ‚Üí controller)
- [x] Confirm **server-side validation** handled the errors  
  **Proof:**  
  - `POST /Register` observed in DevTools Network tab (status **200**)  
  - Response HTML contained server-rendered `<div class="validation-summary-errors">`  
    with `<li>` items: *‚ÄúThe Email field is required.‚Äù*, *‚ÄúThe Password field is required.‚Äù*, etc.
- [x] Re-enable JavaScript (Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí ‚ÄúEnable JavaScript‚Äù)


**Validation Libraries Load**
- [x] Check browser console: jquery.validate.min.js loads (despite load order warning)
- [x] Model attributes ([Required], [EmailAddress]) trigger validation

**Notes**:
- Most forms use standard model validation attributes (work correctly)
- Album Art URL only has [StringLength(1024)] - accepts any string up to 1024 chars
- jQuery Validate load order issue documented in view-migration-tasks.md (Phase 4f)

**Smoke Test Verdict**: ‚úÖ PASS - Basic validation infrastructure works (client + server)

### Layout/Rendering Issues: None - Not up to modern standards but no blocking issues
Legend: **None** | **Minor** | **Major**
[Describe any CSS/layout problems]

### Performance Observations
**Purpose:** Quick baseline only ‚Äî detect major regressions, not for benchmarking.  
**Method:** Disable cache, reload, note ‚ÄúLoad‚Äù time from Network tab (single sample).

| Page | Load Time (ms) | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Home | 128 | - |
| Store Manager | 344 | 135 Albums from seed |
| Checkout completion | 144 | Includes POST ‚Üí 302 ‚Üí confirmation page (single navigation) |

## Issues Log

### Issue #1: Duplicate ID Attributes on Registration Form
**Issue Type**: Phase-4 Fix
**Category**: HTML Validation / Accessibility
**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Navigate to /Account/Register
2. Open DevTools console

**Expected**: Each form element has unique `id` attribute
**Actual**: Both UserRole radio buttons have `id="UserRole"`
**Console Warning**: `[DOM] Found 2 elements with non-unique id #UserRole`

**Impact**: 
- HTML validation failure
- Potential accessibility issues with screen readers
- Future JavaScript bugs if code references `#UserRole`

**Current Behavior**: Radio buttons function correctly due to `name` attribute grouping
**Resolution**: Phase 4 (view migration to .NET 9)

### Issue #2: Navigation Links Disabled at Tablet/Laptop Widths
**Issue Type**: Scope Variance Candidate - phase 5+  
**Viewports**: ‚â§980px (iPad, small laptops)  
**Symptoms**: Genre menu and top nav links non-functional; no hover, no click. Album links still work.  
**Impact**: Core navigation blocked for tablet/small laptop users  
**Root Cause Hypothesis**: CSS media query + jQuery event handler conflict (Bootstrap 3/jQuery legacy)  
**Decision**: Defer to Phase 4e (Bootstrap 5 upgrade) - likely resolved by framework modernization  
**Workaround**: Zoom browser >980px or use direct URLs  
**Browser**: Chrome 140.0.7339.208
