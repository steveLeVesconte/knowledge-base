# Task Description: synchronize smoke test results


## Persona: as  team lead instructing a junior developer

## Primary Focus (what TO do):
- ensuring that the doc smoke-test-chrome.md is complete. Look for ways that the docs resulting from a smoke test are out-of-sync and suggest fixes to smoke-test-chrome.

## Boundaries (what NOT to do):
- Fix the other docs.  
- go overboard - suggest too much.  We want respectable process - not extreme DOD process.

  
  

## Success Criteria (done when):
- smoke-test-chrome.md is as clear and professional and useful.  
- developer has been informed of why changes were made



## Context Priority:

PRIMARY: 
The attached documents were updated continuously as I performed the first smoke test.  I am suspicious that the following flaws may exist:
- unhelpful duplication ( I mean it may be useful duplication - let me know)
- issues indicated in one doc, that should also be reflected in another (for example, I have a lot of issue in "KNOW-LIMITATIONS".  Should some of those be reflected at the end of smoke-test-chrome)
- smoke-test-chrome.md
- KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md
- project-outline.md
- PARKING-LOG.md
- PROJECT-LOG.md



        
SECONDARY:
