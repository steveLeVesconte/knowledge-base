### 2025-10-10 | Phase 1a HTTPS Testing Scope Decision

**Key Decisions Made**
- **HTTPS configuration deferred to Phase 2a** (Azure deployment)
- Rationale: Local HTTPS adds complexity with limited value in phase 1 
- Phase 2a will begin with dedicated HTTPS smoke test as gate before database migration

**Context: OWIN Authentication & External Providers**
- Current configuration: OWIN cookie authentication (ApplicationCookie) over HTTP
- External OAuth providers (Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Twitter) are **commented out** in `Startup.Auth.cs`
- External providers will not be enabled until **Phases 4-5** 
- Phase 2 HTTPS testing scope limited to:
  - OWIN ApplicationCookie authentication over HTTPS
  - Session state over HTTPS (shopping cart)
  - Anti-forgery tokens over HTTPS
  - Mixed content validation (CDN resources)

**Risk Assessment**
- **Risk**: HTTPS-specific issues discovered late (Phase 2 instead of Phase 1)
- **Likelihood**: Medium - HTTPS can expose cookie/session issues not visible over HTTP
- **Impact**: High - Could block Phase 2 Azure deployment if critical issues found
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Phase 2a begins with HTTPS validation as first task (gate decision)
  - All Phase 1 smoke tests repeated over HTTPS before proceeding
  - OWIN middleware expected to work transparently over HTTPS (no code changes anticipated)

**Documentation Updates**
- Updated `smoke-test-chrome.md` with `[DEFERRED]` status and Phase 2a testing scope
- Updated `project-outline.md` Phase 2 to include HTTPS validation as first task
- Expanded `KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md` HTTPS section with risk assessment and mitigation strategy
- Added checkbox status legend for clarity on deferred/N/A test items

**Why This Decision**
- Initial attempt to configue HTTPS blocked smoke testing.  Remediaton attemps lasted more than an hour.  Fixing this is not a smoke test concern. - document and move on.

**Next Session Goals**
- Continue Phase 1a: Complete smoke testing over HTTP
- Document OWIN cookie authentication behavior (Phase 1 baseline)
- Capture performance baselines (HTTP only - HTTPS baselines in Phase 2a)


## Log Entries

### 2025-10-08 | Phase 1a â†’ 1b Transition

**Key Decisions Made**
- Added phase-4e (Bootstrap upgrade) and phase-4f (UI integration) to Phase 4 scope
- Rationale: Bootstrap 3.4.1 EOL creates security debt; fixing views anyway during migration

**Work Completed**
- [x] GitHub repository created with branch protection rules
- [x] Initial documentation: README, project-outline, CONTRIBUTING, KNOWN-LIMITATIONS
- [x] Parking lot system established for deferred items

**Discoveries & Risks**
- Identified jQuery/Ajax browser compatibility concerns (parked for Phase 4 testing)
- Database validation strategy needed before Phase 2 (documented in parking lot)

**Next Session Goals**
- Begin Phase 1a: local environment validation
- Document ASP.NET Identity 2.2.2 implementation
- Baseline performance metrics capture

### 2025-10-02 | Phase 0 Complete

**Work Completed**
- [x] Project chosen: MvcMusicStore (meets learning + portfolio goals)
- [x] project-outline.md with 10-phase migration plan
- [x] Branching strategy: phase-major with sub-branches for granular work
- [x] Repository policies: require PR reviews, protect main branch

**Key Insights**
- Dual-purpose approach (AZ-204 + portfolio) influences phase structure
- Bootstrap upgrade necessary despite adding scope (security + completeness)

**Time Invested**: ~1 week (planning and research)
