## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Session Management
- [ ] Session maintains across page navigation **PASS**
- [ ] Session timeout works (default 20 min, sliding expiration) **PASS - NOT EXHAUSTIVE**
- [ ] Session expires on logout **FAIL** (expected behavior, but problematic for cart)

### Error Handling
- [ ] Navigate to non-existent page (`/DoesNotExist`) - appropriate 404 **PASS**
- [ ] Intentionally trigger server error - custom error page (not YSOD) **PASS**

**Result**: PASS - custom error configuration works correctly in both dev and production modes.
Test exception code removed after verification.

### Security Verification
- [ ] Anonymous user cannot access `/StoreManager` - redirects to login
- [ ] Visitor user cannot access `/StoreManager` **FAIL** SAME BUG AS ADMIN

**Finding**: Both Admin and Visitor roles exhibit same behavior - redirect to login 
instead of proper authorization check. This is the authorization bug discovered during 
admin testing (see PROJECT-LOG.md investigation).

**Workaround**: Access `/StoreManager` while not logged in, then login from redirect.

### Anti-Forgery Token Verification
- [ ] View source on Register form - `__RequestVerificationToken` present
- [ ] Token has long random value (100+ chars, base64-encoded)
- [ ] Token changes on page refresh (not static)
- [ ] Checked 3 other forms (Login, Album Create, Checkout) - all have tokens
- [ ] Cookie `__RequestVerificationToken` present in browser

**Result**: **PASS** - CSRF protection active via ASP.NET MVC anti-forgery tokens

### HTTPS Enforcement
- [DEFERRED] HTTPS enforced (if configured)

**Configuration Status**: NOT CONFIGURED for local development

**Deferral Decision**: 
- HTTPS configuration deferred to **Phase 2a** (Azure deployment requirement)
- Local Phase 1 testing proceeds over HTTP only
- No local HTTPS testing attempted in Phase 1

**Risk Assessment**: 
- **Risk**: Late discovery of HTTPS-specific issues (cookies, OWIN auth, mixed content)
- **Likelihood**: Medium - HTTPS can expose cookie/auth issues not visible over HTTP
- **Impact**: High - Could block Phase 2 Azure deployment if critical issues found
- **Mitigation**: Phase 2a begins with dedicated HTTPS smoke test before database migration

**Rationale**: 
- Initial attempt to configure HTTPS blocked smoke testing. Remediation attempts lasted more than an hour. Fixing this is not a smoke test concern - document and move on.


### Validation (Basic Smoke Test)

**Client-Side Validation**
- [ ] Register form: Submit with empty email - validation message displays before server request
- [ ] Register form: Submit with invalid email format - validation message displays

### üß™ Server-Side Validation Smoke Test (bypass client-side validation)

- [ ] Disable JavaScript in Chrome (DevTools ‚Üí Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí "Disable JavaScript")
- [ ] Open **Register** form
- [ ] Submit with empty required fields
- [ ] Observe full page reload (POST ‚Üí controller)
- [ ] Confirm **server-side validation** handled the errors  
  **Proof:**  
  - `POST /Register` observed in DevTools Network tab (status **200**)  
  - Response HTML contained server-rendered `<div class="validation-summary-errors">`  
    with `<li>` items: *"The Email field is required."*, *"The Password field is required."*, etc.
- [ ] Re-enable JavaScript (Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí "Enable JavaScript")


**Validation Libraries Load**
- [ ] Check browser console: jquery.validate.min.js loads (despite load order warning)
- [ ] Model attributes ([Required], [EmailAddress]) trigger validation

**Notes**:
- Most forms use standard model validation attributes (work correctly)
- Album Art URL only has [StringLength(1024)] - accepts any string up to 1024 chars
- jQuery Validate load order issue documented in view-migration-tasks.md (Phase 4f)

**Smoke Test Verdict**: **PASS** - Basic validation infrastructure works (client + server)

## Browser-Specific Issues

### JavaScript Console Errors : None
legend:**None** | **Minor** | **Major**
[If any, copy exact error message here]

### Layout/Rendering Issues: None - Not up to modern standards but no blocking issues
Legend: **None** | **Minor** | **Major**
[Describe any CSS/layout problems]

### Performance Observations
**Purpose:** Quick baseline only ‚Äî detect major regressions, not for benchmarking.  
**Method:** Disable cache, reload, note "Load" time from Network tab (single sample).

| Page | Load Time (ms) | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Home |  | - |
| Store Manager |  | 135 Albums from seed |
| Checkout completion |  | Includes POST ‚Üí 302 ‚Üí confirmation page (single navigation) |

## Test Result Summary

**Upgrade Readiness Status:**  GO  
*("GO" means the app builds, runs, and can be smoke-tested; issues found are recorded for later remediation.)*

**Blocker Definition:**  
A "blocker" is any issue that prevents effective smoke testing (e.g., compile failure, missing dependencies, or startup crash).

**Findings Summary**
- Blockers: 0  
- Phase-X Fixes: 0  
- Scope Variance Candidates: 1

---

## Issue Type Legend
- **Blocker**: Prevents smoke testing or app startup
- **Phase-X Fix**: Will be resolved during specific migration phase (not scope creep)
- **Scope Variance Candidate**: New work outside original migration scope - requires approval

## Issues Log

### Issue #1: Checkout Button Visible on Empty Cart
**Issue Type**: Scope Variance Candidate
**Category**: UX / Business Logic
**Classification**: Tutorial App Limitation (deferred)

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Add items to shopping cart
2. Remove all items (click "Remove from cart" until cart empty)
3. Observe "Checkout" button still visible
4. Click "Checkout" button

**Expected (Ideal)**: 
- Checkout button disabled or hidden when cart empty
- Clicking checkout on empty cart shows friendly message ("Your cart is empty")

**Actual**: 
- Checkout button remains enabled on empty cart
- Clicking proceeds to `/Checkout/AddressAndPayment` form
- User can submit order with $0.00 total and zero items

**Impact**: 
- Minor UX issue - confusing to proceed through checkout with empty cart
- Potential to create $0.00 orders in database (data quality issue)

**Baseline Behavior**: Tutorial app does not validate cart state before checkout
**Resolution**: Defer to post-Phase 5 (tutorial app limitation - see KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md)
**Migration Note**: Phase 4 must preserve this behavior (functional parity requirement)

**Validation in Future Phases**:
- Phase 4: Verify empty cart checkout still behaves identically (regression check)
- Phase 5+: Consider fix if addressing tutorial app limitations

**Related Items**: 
- Shopping cart not user-isolated (see KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md)
- Order.Total column unpopulated (see KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md)



### Issue #2: jQuery Validation Load Order Error on Checkout
**Issue Type**: Phase-4f Fix
**Category**: JavaScript / Client-Side Validation
**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Navigate to `/ShoppingCart` with items in cart
2. Click "Checkout" button  
3. Open Edge DevTools Console (F12)

**Expected**: jQuery validation libraries load without errors
**Actual**: Console shows two `ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined` errors

**Console Errors**:
jquery.validate.min.js:4  Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
jquery.validate.unobtrusive.min.js:33  Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined



**Root Cause**: `AddressAndPayment.cshtml` has duplicate script references:
- Hard-coded `<script>` tags at top of view (render immediately, before jQuery loads)
- `@section Scripts` with `@Scripts.Render("~/bundles/jqueryval")` at bottom (renders after jQuery)
- Result: Validation libraries execute before jQuery is available

**Impact**: 
- Client-side form validation disabled during initial page load
- Server-side validation still functions (no data integrity risk)
- Minor UX degradation - validation errors only appear after form submission

**Current Workaround**: Server-side validation handles all validation (functional parity maintained)

**Resolution**: Phase 4f (view migration) - will be fixed when rewriting views for .NET Core Razor syntax and replacing ASP.NET MVC bundling system

**Cross-Reference**: Same pattern observed in Chrome testing (smoke-test-chrome.md)

**Network Tab Evidence**: 
- `jquery.validate.min.js` loads at line 630
- `jquery-3.3.1.js` loads at line 1040 (after validation libs)
- All scripts return 200 OK; issue is execution order, not loading failure
