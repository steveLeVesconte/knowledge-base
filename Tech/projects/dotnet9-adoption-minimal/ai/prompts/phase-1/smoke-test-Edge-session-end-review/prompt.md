# Task Description: create an xUnit test outline including a list of xUnit test in a hierarchical list to use in this project


## Persona: as a Lead Developer coaching a junior Developer

## Primary Focus (what TO do):
- create a list of tests (within categories) to include as I add unit testing to this project.  

## Boundaries (what NOT to do):
- go overboard - suggest too much.  We want respectable process - not extreme DOD process. 

  
  

## Success Criteria (done when):
- A list with names of tests and enough code context or architecture context to allow me to begin work on the test.  The list should propose goldilocks coverage - not overboard but respectable - and enough to be useful during stage 4 when everything (including the tests) breaks.
  


## Context Priority:

PRIMARY: 


- project files
	-- project-outline.md
	
- file-tree-partial.md
	
- subset of code files as clues:
	-- AccountController.cs
	-- BundleConfig.cs
	-- CheckoutController.cs
	-- FilterConfig.cs
	-- HomeController.cs
	-- IdentityConfig.cs
	-- Index.cshtml
	-- ManageController.cs
	-- packages.config
	-- project-outline.md
	-- prompt.md
	-- RouteConfig.cs
	-- ShoppingCartController.cs
	-- Startup.Auth.cs
	-- Startup.cs
	-- StoreController.cs
	-- StoreManagerController.cs
	-- _Layout.cshtml
