# Task Description: project document assessment


## Persona: as a Hiring Manager

## Primary Focus (what TO do):
- evaluate documents generated up to this point.  Decide if they look ok from the point of view of a hiring manager or a pear reviewer (in a job search situation)

## Boundaries (what NOT to do):
- go overboard - suggest too much.  We want respectable process - not extreme DOD process. 

  
  

## Success Criteria (done when):

- if needed, suggestions for improvements made.
  


## Context Priority:
