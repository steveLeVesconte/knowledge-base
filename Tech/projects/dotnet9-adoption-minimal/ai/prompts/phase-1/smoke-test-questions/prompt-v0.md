# Task Description: discuss smoke test details


## Persona: as  team lead instructing a junior developer

## Primary Focus (what TO do):
- evaluate change to the "registration" smoke test section.  Right level of detail? Go deeper into all of the permutations of validation violations (or is that too deep for smoke?) 

## Boundaries (what NOT to do):
- go overboard - suggest too much.  We want respectable process - not extreme DOD process.

## Success Criteria (done when):
â–¡ clear procedure for junior developer plus conceptual guide


## Context Priority:
- Before and After smoke test sections pasted in blow:

PRIMARY: 
 - project-outline.md


        
SECONDARY: - 


- work-breakdown.md
- smoke-test-chrome.md
