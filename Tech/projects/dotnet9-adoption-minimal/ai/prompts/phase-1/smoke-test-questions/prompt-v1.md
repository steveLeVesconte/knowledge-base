# Task Description: consider adding ux mittigation tasks in phase-4


## Persona: as  team lead instructing a junior developer

## Primary Focus (what TO do):
- evaluate phase-4.  In light of the fact that we only want ui parity (not improvement) and will stay with the old version of bootstrap if we can - do we need to add some task related to needed view breakage and repair somewhere in this phase?

## Boundaries (what NOT to do):
- go overboard - suggest too much.  We want respectable process - not extreme DOD process.
- assume the organization is the size of a regional bank working on in-house software.
  
  
  

## Success Criteria (done when):
â–¡ clear procedure for junior developer plus conceptual guide


## Context Priority:
