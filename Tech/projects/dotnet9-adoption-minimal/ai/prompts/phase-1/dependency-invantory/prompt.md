# Task Description: Draft complete `dependency-inventory.md` - Complete package list with versions by inventorying attached context documents

## Contingency:  If there is a known requirment which cannot be fulfilled using the attach context, note it inline in square brackets and in a notation at the end of the document.

## Persona: as  primary developer

## Primary Focus (what TO do):
- create a dependency-inventory.md document consistent with "work-breakout.md" - professional in appearance and technically complete.

## Boundaries (what NOT to do):
- go overboard - suggest too much.  We want respectable process - not extreme DOD process.

## Success Criteria (done when):
â–¡ dependency-inventory.md fulfils implied promises of work-breakout.md


## Context Priority:
PRIMARY: 
  - work-breakout.md
  - packages.config
  - MvcMusicStore.csproj
  - Web.config
  - Startup.cs
  - subset-of-project-outline-in-focus.md
  - file-tree.md
        
SECONDARY: - project-outline.md - for general context only
