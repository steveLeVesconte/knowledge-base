Context: 40yrs+ Software Dev (MVC, SQL, C#, JS/HTML/CSS),
- learning (.NET Core and Azure and IaC)

I added this new section (Phase 0: Planning)  (below the dashed line in this prompt) to project-outline.md

AI Task:
decide if the new section is consistent with the rest of the document and useful.  Will it help keep me on track?  Will it contribute to the success of the project? Will it contribute to the usefulness of the repository as both a guide for others and a showcase for me?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Phase 0: Planning

**Branch Strategy**: phase-0-planning - one branch

- choose project for upgrade
- decide on Project Practices
	- investigate scope and tasks
	- make project-outline with ordered sequence of phases and tasks (this document)
	- branch strategy 
		- granularity
		- merge pattern
	- repository policy and settings
		- merge policy for main
	- repository documentation decisions:
		- initial README.md
		- CONTRIBUTING.md
		- use a PROJECT-LOG.md 
		
**Completion Criteria**:

- [ ] Initial project chosen
- [ ] project-outline (this document) complete, reviewed and committed 
- [ ] GitHub repository created, named, with policy decisions
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md - completed, reviewed and committed
- [ ] PROJECT-LOG.md with template for daily updates - completed, reviewed and committed
