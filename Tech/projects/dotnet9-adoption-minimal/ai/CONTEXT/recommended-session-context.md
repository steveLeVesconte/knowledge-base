## Recommended New Session Context:

### **Essential Documents:**

1. **Updated project-outline.md** (the final version from this conversation)
2. **base-project-context.md** (unchanged, still accurate)
3. **Key source files** for reference:
    - `Startup.cs` and `Startup.Auth.cs` (authentication reality)
    - `Web.config` (current configuration)
    - `packages.config` (dependency state)

### **Context Summary Document**

Consider creating a brief "current-state.md" that captures:

```markdown
# Current Project State (Post-Planning)

## Authentication Reality
- Local accounts only (ASP.NET Identity 2.2.2)
- OAuth packages installed but not configured
- OWIN pipeline active for cookie auth

## Migration Plan Confirmed  
- Phase 0: Foundation (3 sub-phases)
- Phase 1: Platform migration (.NET Framework â†’ .NET 9)
- Phase 1.5: Modern OAuth (post-platform migration)

## Ready for Implementation
- Test coverage strategy
- Azure cost optimization
- Phase 0a execution planning
```

## Suggested New Session Opening:

```
I'm working on a .NET Framework 4.6.1 to .NET 9 migration project (MVC Music Store). 

Context documents:
- project-outline.md (10-phase migration plan)
- base-project-context.md (current app details)
- [include key source files]

We've completed the planning phase. Ready to discuss:
1. Test coverage strategy for Phase 0a
2. Azure cost-saving strategies for development/testing
3. Implementation specifics for Phase 0 execution

Current app state: Local authentication only, no OAuth currently active.
