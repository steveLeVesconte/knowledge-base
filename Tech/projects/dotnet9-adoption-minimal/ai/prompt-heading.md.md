I'm working on a .NET Framework 4.6.1 to .NET 9 migration project (MVC Music Store). 

Context documents:
- project-outline.md (10-phase migration plan)
- base-project-context.md (current app details)
- [include key source files]

We've completed the planning phase. Ready to discuss:
1. Test coverage strategy for Phase 0a
2. Azure cost-saving strategies for development/testing
3. Implementation specifics for Phase 0 execution

Current app state: Local authentication only, no OAuth currently active.
