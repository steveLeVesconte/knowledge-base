### Method 1: Clear Redirect Cache  (this method is better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

**In Chrome**:

1. **Settings** (chrome://settings/)
2. **Privacy and security** → **Clear browsing data**
3. **Advanced tab**
4. Check **ONLY**: "Cached images and files"
5. Time range: **"All time"**
6. **Clear data**
7. **Close ALL Chrome windows**
8. **Reopen Chrome**
9. Try `http://localhost:59188/`

### Method 2: Clear Redirect Cache via DevTools  **(STOP!  USE METHOD 1 INSTEAD)**

**Open Chrome DevTools** (F12):

1. **Network tab**
2. **Right-click** in network panel
3. **"Clear browser cache"**
4. Close DevTools
5. **Close ALL Chrome windows**
6. Reopen
7. Try `http://localhost:59188/`

### Method 3: Override Redirect

**Hold Shift while clicking refresh** (hard reload):

- Bypasses cache
- Forces fresh request
- Might work once, but won't stick

## Why HSTS Clear Alone Didn't Work

**HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)** is different from **301 redirect caching**.

**HSTS**: Server says "Always use HTTPS for my domain"  
**301 Cache**: Server says "This URL moved permanently"

**Chrome has TWO separate caches**:

1. HSTS cache (cleared with chrome://net-internals/#hsts)
2. Redirect cache (cleared with "Clear browsing data")

**You cleared #1 but not #2** → Problem persisted

---

## The Fix That Will Work

**Try this sequence exactly**:

```
1. Close ALL Chrome windows

2. Open Chrome

3. Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Clear browsing data)

4. Advanced tab

5. Check ONLY: "Cached images and files"

6. Time range: "All time"

7. Clear data

8. chrome://net-internals/#hsts
   - Delete domain: localhost

9. Close ALL Chrome windows again

10. Open Chrome fresh

11. Type: http://localhost:59188/
    (Must include http://)

12. Should work now
```

**This clears both caches** - redirect cache + HSTS cache.

## Why Port Change Worked

**Port 54321 has no history**:

- Never got a 301 redirect ✅
- No cached HTTPS decision ✅
- Chrome treats it as new URL ✅
- Works perfectly ✅

**Port 59188 has history**:

- Got 301 redirect yesterday ❌
- Chrome cached "always HTTPS" ❌
- Treats as known HTTPS URL ❌
- Auto-converts to HTTPS ❌

---

## The Answer to Your Question

**"How did my HTTPS experiment yesterday result in a change to Chrome?"**

**Answer**:

1. **Your redirect sent HTTP 301 "Moved Permanently"**
2. **Chrome cached this decision indefinitely**
3. **Chrome now auto-converts HTTP → HTTPS for port 59188**
4. **Git can't revert Chrome's cache**
5. **Edge/Firefox unaffected (didn't receive 301, or cleared it)**

**The culprit**: `redirectType="Permanent"` in your redirect rule

**Chrome's behavior**: Working as designed (caching 301 aggressively)

**The fix**: Clear Chrome's redirect cache (different from HSTS)

---

## My Recommendation

**Try the full cache clear** (both redirect + HSTS) using steps above.

**If that works**: Great, port 59188 usable in Chrome ✅

**If it doesn't work**: Chrome is being stubborn, just use Edge or keep port 54321

**Don't spend more than 5 minutes on this** - you have Phase 1 work to complete!

---

## The Real Lesson

**When testing redirects**:

- Use `redirectType="Temporary"` (HTTP 302)
- Not `redirectType="Permanent"` (HTTP 301)
- Permanent redirects are VERY sticky in browsers
- Hard to undo once cached

**For future reference**: Always test redirects with 302 first, only use 301 when you're absolutely sure.

Now try the full Chrome cache clear and let me know if port 59188 works! 🎯
