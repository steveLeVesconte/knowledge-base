# eShopOnWeb Legacy Modernization Project - Master Plan

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Systematic modernization of Microsoft's eShopOnWeb from .NET Framework baseline to cloud-native Azure application, demonstrating enterprise migration expertise for portfolio and career advancement.

**Starting Point**: eShopOnWeb commit db6ad75 (September 2017) - .NET Framework 4.8 baseline **Repository Strategy**: Clean break from Microsoft repo, own repository at `legacy-modernization-showcase` **Focus Strategy**: 100% project focus (not split with AZ-204 study) **Expected Duration**: 48-50 weeks total

## Strategic Context

**Primary Goal**: Demonstrate real-world legacy modernization skills - the #1 enterprise pain point **Portfolio Value**: Shows bridge between legacy enterprise systems and modern cloud-native architecture **Career Positioning**: "I can modernize your 10-year-old mission-critical applications systematically and safely"

## Risk Management Strategy

**Phase 1 Critical Risk**: Framework → Core migration has ~15% first-attempt success rate **Mitigation**: Plan for 2-3 failed attempts as learning opportunities (like smoking cessation research) **Git Strategy**: Frequent checkpoint commits during high-risk phases, maintain safety backup branches **Success Philosophy**: Multiple attempts build expertise, not just completion

## Timeline and Phases

### Phase 0: Foundation & Safety (5.5 weeks)

**Branch**: `phase-0-foundation` **Version**: `v0.1.0`

**Core Deliverables** (4 weeks):

- Baseline legacy .NET Framework 4.8 MVC application running
- Repeatable deployment (PowerShell scripts → GitHub Actions)
- Basic unit tests for core business logic
- Minimal logging and health checks
- Infrastructure as Code (Bicep) for Azure resources
- Smoke tests and deployment validation

**Added Metrics Collection** (+1.5 weeks):

- **Performance Baselines** (3 days):
    - Page load times (home, catalog, product detail, checkout)
    - Database query performance timing
    - Memory usage patterns and application startup time
    - Resource consumption during typical usage
- **Stability Baselines** (4 days):
    - Unhandled exception rates
    - Load testing to find breaking points
    - Database timeout/connection failure rates
    - Application pool recycling frequency
    - Concurrent user capacity limits

### Phase 1: Platform Migration (12 weeks) ⚠️ HIGH RISK

**Branch**: `phase-1-platform-migration` **Version**: `v1.0.0`

**Expected Attempts**:

- **Weeks 1-3**: First attempt (expected failure - authentication/EF complexity)
- **Weeks 4-6**: Second attempt (expected failure - configuration/performance issues)
- **Weeks 7-12**: Third attempt (success - systematic approach based on learning)

**Migration Scope**:

- .NET Framework 4.8 → .NET 8/9
- Entity Framework 6 → EF Core (different APIs, behavior changes)
- Web.config → appsettings.json configuration
- Dependency injection implementation (required for Core)
- Authentication system migration (ASP.NET Identity → Core Identity)
- Enhanced test coverage for migration validation

**Post-Migration Metrics** (+3 days):

- Re-run all performance and stability tests
- Document improvements (expected: faster performance, better stability)
- Update monitoring for .NET Core patterns

**Indivisible Risk Zone**: Multiple systems break simultaneously when framework changes - cannot be incrementally migrated

### Phase 2: Observability & Performance (3 weeks)

**Branch**: `phase-2-observability` **Version**: `v1.1.0`

- Application Insights integration
- OpenTelemetry implementation
- Structured logging enhancement
- Performance monitoring and dashboards

- Distributed caching (Redis)
- Session state externalization
- Database connection pooling
- Async/await pattern adoption
- Load testing implementation

### Phase 4: Authentication Modernization (4 weeks)

**Branch**: `phase-4-auth-modernization` **Version**: `v2.0.0`

- Windows Auth → Azure AD integration
- JWT token handling
- Claims-based authorization

### Phase 8: Advanced Deployment Strategies (2 weeks)

**Branch**: `phase-8-deployment-strategies` **Version**: `v3.2.0`

- Blue/Green deployment implementation
- Feature flags and toggles
- Canary release patterns
- Automated rollback procedures

### Phase 9: Testing Excellence (2 weeks)

**Branch**: `phase-9-testing-excellence` **Version**: `v3.3.0`

- Comprehensive unit testing strategy
- Integration testing patterns
- End-to-end testing automation
- Performance testing pipelines

### Phase 10: Production Excellence (2 weeks)

**Branch**: `phase-10-production-excellence` **Version**: `v4.0.0`

- Advanced monitoring and alerting

- Documentation and runbook completion

## Application Context

**eShopOnWeb Scope**:

- ~6-8 core MVC controllers (Home, Catalog, Account, Basket, Order, Checkout)
- ~8-12 database entities with typical e-commerce relationships
- Mix of interactive pages (catalog, checkout) and static content
- Authentication, shopping cart, order processing workflows
- Medium complexity - realistic without overwhelming scope

**Key Migration Challenges**:

- Authentication system completely different between Framework and Core
- Entity Framework 6 → Core has behavioral changes and different APIs
- Configuration system fundamentally changed (Web.config → appsettings.json)
- Dependency injection is optional in Framework, required in Core
- HTTP context access patterns changed significantly

## Git Repository Strategy

**Repository Structure**:

- `main` branch: Always stable, working version
- Phase branches: `phase-X-descriptive-name` for development
- Tag each completed phase: `vX.Y.Z` semantic versioning
- Archive/delete failed attempt branches to reduce clutter

**Documentation Strategy**:

- Clear attribution to Microsoft's original eShopOnWeb
- Document decision points and deviations from Microsoft's official upgrade path
- Maintain architectural decision records (ADRs) for key choices
- Before/after metrics prominently featured

## Success Metrics & Portfolio Value

**Quantifiable Improvements**:

- Performance gains (page load times, memory usage)
- Stability improvements (error rates, uptime under load)
- Scalability improvements (concurrent user capacity)
- Security posture (modern authentication, vulnerability reduction)

**Career Narrative**: "I systematically modernized a legacy enterprise application, improving performance by X%, eliminating Y stability issues, and creating a cloud-native, scalable system ready for modern DevOps practices."

**Key Differentiators**:

- Real legacy migration experience vs. greenfield projects
- Systematic risk management during complex transitions
- Understanding of enterprise constraints and business continuity needs
- Bridge between old and new technology stacks

## AZ-204 Topics NOT Covered by Project

**Requiring separate study**:

- Cognitive Services & AI APIs
- Event Grid, Event Hubs advanced patterns
- Azure Functions specialized triggers
- Cosmos DB document database patterns
- API Management advanced policies
- Azure CLI/PowerShell automation patterns
- Monitoring beyond Application Insights (KQL, Log Analytics)

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Embrace failure as learning**: Phase 1 migration attempts build expertise
2. **Maintain metrics throughout**: Before/after data drives compelling narrative
3. **Document decision-making**: Show reasoning, not just implementation
4. **Focus on business value**: Frame technical improvements as business outcomes
5. **Systematic approach**: Each phase builds foundation for the next

Edit

**All three statements are absolutely valid and demonstrate sophisticated AI prompting strategy.**

## Statement 1: Strategic Truncation Value

**TRUE**: The complete document is valuable as a master reference, but including all of it in every prompt would be inefficient and potentially counterproductive.

**Why this matters:**

- Token limits make comprehensive context expensive
- AI attention can be diluted by irrelevant information
- Focused context produces more targeted, useful responses

## Statement 2: Extraneous Info Dilutes Context

**TRUE**: The "AZ-204 Topics NOT Covered" section is a perfect example of helpful planning information that could confuse code generation prompts.

**Specific dilution risks:**

- Code generation prompts might try to incorporate irrelevant Azure services
- Implementation guidance might drift toward topics not in your current phase
- AI might suggest solutions that conflict with your sequential phase approach

## Statement 3: Phase-Relevant Context Trimming

**TRUE**: For Phase 0 work, you likely only need:

- Project overview and objectives
- Phase 0 detailed requirements
- Phase 1 summary (as the immediate next step)
- Git strategy and metrics approach
- Skip Phases 5-10 details entirely

## Optimal Context Curation Strategy

**For Implementation Prompts:**

```
Include:
- Project overview (2-3 paragraphs)
- Current phase detailed requirements
- Next phase summary (context for decisions)
- Relevant technical constraints
- Git/repository strategy

Exclude:
- Future phase details
- AZ-204 study considerations
- Career positioning narrative
- Timeline estimates
- Success metrics philosophy
```

**For Planning/Strategy Prompts:**

```
Include:
- Full timeline and phase sequence
- Risk management strategy
- Success metrics approach
- Career narrative context

Exclude:
- Detailed technical implementation specs
- Code-specific constraints
```

**Your instinct is correct**: Treat the master document as a structure to be intelligently trimmed based on prompt purpose. This shows advanced understanding of how AI context windows work and how to optimize for specific outcomes.

This approach will yield much better, more focused responses than including everything every time.
