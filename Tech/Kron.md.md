## Today’s Focus
Adapted Obsidian-based note system for both tech and personal notes with meta tagging.

## Highlights
- Created single vault at **D:\notes**.
- Set up top-level folders: **Tech** and **Personal**.
- Defined tagging strategy and made master tag list (`00-tags.md`).
- Decided on single-vault approach for easier capture and retrieval.

## Reflections
- Realized that meta-tagging removes the biggest mental friction: deciding where a note belongs.
- Expecting faster, continuous note-taking compared to end-of-day sessions.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Import key Google Docs/Sheets and starred AI sessions.
- [ ] Create cheatsheets for Git and PowerShell.
- [ ] Add Obsidian Templates plugin for one-click kron entries.
