## The Workflow That Is Sustainable for Session Harvesting

preparation:  create a document prompt-sessions-log in obsidian root

### Step 1: Quick Manual Scan (5 minutes - if value is found, could be 30 minutes )

Ask yourself:

- Does this session contain useful, clear procedures (like this procedure) that I want to incorporate into my practice?  
	- if so, capture them in an expanding procedure focused doc like "prompt-templates"
- Does this session contain useful, clear code snippets that I want to have handy?  
	- if so, capture them in an expanding code focused doc like "git-cheatsheet.md"
- Does this session contain concepts or ideas especially project ideas or resume strategy that I feel would be useful to revisit in the future?  
	- if so, create a file with a somewhat descriptive name - but not too long and place the file in obsidian either in an related folder or in a generic "ai-Sessions" folder.  Note: many sessions will have too many topics to include in the filename so just pick one. no more than 30 seconds to decide where!  Do this only for high value sessions.  
	  
example file name: "modernization-project-vs-az204-completion-2025-09-28.md"

at the top of the file, create a short expression of the value of the file.  Where useful, include searchable titles.  May include crude generalizations.  

include filename and date and file path

copy this entire new heading zone into create a document prompt-sessions-log.

If important decisions are made during the session, write one-line description in the appropriate project PROJECT-LOG.md including possible one in the resume-job search folder (with date of course).  If absolutely needed (probably not), include a mention of the session in the PROJECT-LOG entry about the decision
