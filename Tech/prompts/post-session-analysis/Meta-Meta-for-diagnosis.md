# context:
I have a chat session that has been very fruitful, but, late in the session, a large number of prompts produce non-working solutions to a browser-cache problem (the root cause was not known until the end of the session)

I want a prompt to ask for post-session analysis of the cause of a long string of fails.

The goal is to answer the questions:
Was fail do to the nature of the presenting issue?
Was the fail do to context dilution?
Was the fail do to failure to provide the most relevant context?
Was the fail do to "random AI hallucination".  Note, I consider this answer is usually a catchall hiding "poor prompting technique"

The overall goal is to improve my skill as a prompter by getting better info on sessions that seemed to flail.

I am attaching and example prompt that has a similar but still different approach.

AI Task:  Provide one of two possible responses:
- a new prompts for this new post-processing requirement
- just tell me that the existing prompt attached is good enough for this purpose.
