## üìä Session Resource Consumption

**Token Budget Status:**
- Estimated tokens used: ~[X] of ~200,000 available
- Capacity consumed: [X]% 
- Budget health: [HEALTHY <25% | MODERATE 25-60% | ELEVATED 60-80% | CRITICAL >80%]

**Context Window Pressure:**
- Conversation exchanges: [X]
- Average tokens per exchange: ~[X]
- Context density: [LOW | MODERATE | HIGH | SATURATED]
  - LOW: Plenty of room for complexity
  - MODERATE: Normal working range
  - HIGH: Approaching limits, simplify if possible
  - SATURATED: Risk of context loss, consider fresh session

**Rework Overhead:**
- Clean exchanges (first-try success): [X]
- Refinement exchanges (iterations): [X]
- Rework ratio: [X]% (Target: <20%)
- Efficiency rating: [OPTIMAL <10% | GOOD 10-20% | ACCEPTABLE 20-35% | WASTEFUL >35%]

**Conversation Health Indicators:**
- üü¢ **Safe to continue** - All metrics healthy, no concerns
- üü° **Monitor closely** - [specific metric] approaching limits
- üü† **Consider wrapping up** - [specific concern] showing strain
- üî¥ **Start fresh session** - [critical issue] compromising quality

**Over-Optimization Risk Assessment:**
- Unnecessary refinement cycles detected: [count]
- Diminishing returns threshold: [reached/not reached]
- **Verdict:** [LEAN - stopped at good enough | BALANCED - appropriate polish | OVER-OPTIMIZED - chasing perfection]

**Reality Check:**
[One-line assessment: e.g., "You used 3% of available tokens with 15% rework - this session had plenty of headroom, no optimization needed" OR "You're at 72% capacity with high context density - wrap up soon or start fresh"]

**Strategy Scope:**
- Challenge: [EF Core migration | architecture redesign | etc.]
- Current state complexity: [simple | moderate | complex]
- Target state clarity: [crystal clear | some unknowns | exploratory]

**Strategy Quality:**
- Completeness: [all phases covered | gaps in X area]
- Risk assessment: [thorough | surface-level | missing]
- Sequencing logic: [sound | some issues | questionable]
- Rollback plans: [included | partial | absent]

**Requirements Capture:**
- Initial problem statement: [clear | adequate | vague]
- Constraints identified: [X explicit constraints captured]
- Assumptions documented: [Y assumptions made]
- Missing information discovered: [Z gaps found during planning]

**Progressive Refinement:**
- Initial strategy quality: [1-5]
- Refinement rounds needed: [count]
- Major pivots: [count] - [what triggered them]
- Convergence: [reached solid plan | still exploratory | stuck]

**Prompt Efficiency Analysis:**
‚úÖ **Most productive prompts:**
   - Example: "Prompt #2: 'List migration risks by probability √ó impact, rank top 5'"
   - Value: [what insight this unlocked]

‚ö†Ô∏è **Inefficient prompts:**
   - Example: "Prompt #6: 'What should I consider?' was too broad"
   - Cost: [vague response, needed X follow-ups]

**Actionability Assessment:**
- Ready to execute: [yes | needs detail in X areas | too high-level]
- Effort estimates: [included | partial | missing]
- Success criteria: [defined | implicit | unclear]
- Decision points: [clearly marked | somewhat | buried]

**Token Economics:**
- Strategy tokens: ~[X]
- Exploratory/dead-end tokens: ~[X]% 
- Most valuable exchange: [which prompted key insight]
- Least valuable: [which could have been skipped]

**Learning Insights:**
üéØ **Effective strategy prompting:**
   1. [e.g., "Asking for phased approach with dependencies = better structure"]
   2. [e.g., "Requesting specific deliverables per phase = actionable"]

üéØ **Context that mattered:**
   - [e.g., "Providing current EF version + target version upfront"]
   - [e.g., "Mentioning team size/skill level shaped recommendations"]

üéØ **What slowed progress:**
   - [e.g., "Not defining 'migration complete' criteria early"]
   - [e.g., "Exploring too many alternatives before converging"]

**Session Score: [0-100]**
- Strategy completeness (30pts): [score]
- Actionability (30pts): [score]
- Risk awareness (20pts): [score]
- Efficiency (20pts): [score]

**Next Session Strategy:**
- Define upfront: [what to establish in first prompt]
- Use this prompt structure: [specific format that worked]
- Request explicitly: [what to ask for that was missing]
