## The Workflow That Actually Works

### Step 1: Quick Manual Scan (10 minutes)

Ask yourself:

- Does this session contain useful, clear procedures (like this procedure) that I want to incorporate into my practice?  
	- if so, capture them in an expanding procedure focused doc like "prompt-templates"
- Does this session contain useful, clear code snippets that I want to have handy?  
	- if so, capture them in an expanding code focused doc like "git-cheatsheet.md"
- Use these remaining questions and prompts as "starting point examples of ways to be specific about prompting for harvesting.  try and refine to see what works".  Petty much use these only when you feel there is resume/job interview material in the session:
	- Did I make a decision? (→ use decision extraction prompt)
	- Did I create a framework? (→ use framework extraction prompt)
	- Did I solve a problem? (→ use achievement extraction prompt)
	- Did I identify what NOT to do? (→ use anti-pattern extraction prompt)

### Step 2: Use Specific Prompt (1 minute)

Based on Step 1, use ONE targeted prompt, not multiple generic ones

### Step 3: Validate and Edit Output (10 minutes)

- Check AI didn't hallucinate or over-generalize
- Refine language to match your voice
- Remove fluff and redundancy
- Add specific details AI might have missed

### Step 4: File with Searchable Tags (2 minutes)

Use tags based on when you'll search for it

**Total time:** 20-25 minutes vs 60+ for full manual harvest









## The Better Prompting Strategy


***Use the following as examples of more specific harvesting prompts***

### Instead of generic "summarize for X", use specific extraction prompts:

### For Interview Prep:

**Prompt A: Story Extraction**

```
"Extract from this session:
1. Any decisions I made and the reasoning behind them
2. Frameworks or mental models I can explain in interviews
3. Examples of how I think about trade-offs
4. Specific language patterns that worked well
5. Anti-patterns or mistakes to avoid

Format each as a short paragraph I can review before interviews."
```

**Prompt B: Talking Points**

```
"From this session, create interview talking points about:
1. My approach to [specific topic from session]
2. Questions I asked that show good engineering thinking
3. How I evaluate complexity or risk
4. Examples of strategic thinking I can reference

Keep each point to 2-3 sentences."
```

### For Resume Material:

**Prompt C: Achievement Extraction**

```
"Extract from this session:
1. Any concrete implementations I described (with tech stack)
2. Problems I solved with measurable outcomes
3. Projects I worked on with scope/impact
4. Technical decisions I made with justification
5. Skills I demonstrated (not just mentioned learning about)

Format as bullet points suitable for a resume."
```

**Prompt D: Project Description**

```
"From this session, create a project description for my resume:
- Project title and purpose
- Technologies used
- My role and contributions
- Outcomes or current status
- Key technical challenges addressed

Maximum 3-4 bullet points."
```


### For Interview Prep Sessions:

**Template 1: Decision + Reasoning**

```
From this session, extract:
1. Any strategic decision I made (in one sentence)
2. The 2-3 key reasons for that decision
3. How I would explain this decision-making process in an interview
4. What this decision reveals about my thinking or priorities

Keep total under 200 words.
```

**Template 2: Stories + Examples**

```
From this session, create 2-3 short stories (each 3-4 sentences) that:
1. Show how I approach complex problems
2. Demonstrate learning or growth
3. Reveal strategic thinking
4. Would be relevant in technical interviews

For each story, include: situation, my thinking, and outcome or current state.
```

**Template 3: Anti-patterns**

```
From this session, identify:
1. Any mistakes I should avoid (in interviews or project work)
2. Why each is a mistake (in one sentence)
3. The better alternative approach

Format as "Don't: X. Because: Y. Instead: Z."
```

---

### For Resume Material Sessions:

**Template 4: Achievement Bullets**

```
From this session, extract concrete achievements in resume bullet format:
- Start with action verb
- Include technology/methodology used
- Describe outcome or impact when available
- Maximum 2 lines per bullet

Only include items I've actually completed or significantly progressed, 
not plans or things I'm learning about.
```

**Template 5: Project Description**

```
From this session, create ONE project description:
- Title: [Descriptive project name]
- Purpose: [One sentence]
- Technologies: [Comma-separated list]
- My Role: [What I did/am doing]
- Status: [Complete / In progress with X% done / Specific milestone reached]
- Key Challenge: [One technical challenge I addressed]

Maximum 4 bullet points total for resume use.
```

**Template 6: Skills Demonstrated**

```
From this session, list skills I demonstrated (not just discussed):
- Technical skills I actually used (with context)
- Tools or platforms I worked with hands-on
- Methodologies I applied
- Problem-solving approaches I employed

Exclude: Things I'm only learning about or planning to use.
Format as: Skill: [One sentence showing application]
```
