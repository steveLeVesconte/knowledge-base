Excellent — here’s a **simple, safe 5-minute warm-up and cooldown routine** designed for a **72-year-old recreational kayaker** who’s building strength and flexibility gradually.  
You don’t need any special equipment, and you can do all of it at the launch site or at home.

## 🟢 5-Minute **Pre-Paddle Warm-Up**

Goal: loosen hips, shoulders, and spine so your body moves _with_ the kayak instead of fighting it.

### 1. **March in Place (1 min)**

- Light marching, lifting knees gently.
    
- Add a small arm swing to get circulation going.
    
- Think “wake up the joints,” not “work hard.”
    

### 2. **Torso Twists (1 min)**

- Stand tall, knees slightly bent.
    
- Rotate your upper body side to side like you’re paddling slowly.
    
- Keep your hips mostly still — this mimics the core rotation you’ll use on the water.
    

### 3. **Hip Circles (1 min)**

- Hands on hips, make slow circles — 5 clockwise, 5 counterclockwise.
    
- This lubricates the hip joint and warms the stabilizers that keep you upright in the kayak.
    

### 4. **Knee Bends / Mini-Squats (1 min)**

- Feet shoulder-width apart, bend knees slightly as if sitting back 4–6 inches.
    
- Heels stay down.
    
- Engages your quads and glutes — the same muscles that control your posture in the cockpit.
    

### 5. **Shoulder Rolls + Paddle Reach (1 min)**

- Roll shoulders back and down several times.
    
- Then pretend to paddle gently through air — reach forward and twist the torso each side.
    

> ✅ **Tip:** If you tend to get foot cramps, add 20 seconds of ankle circles or toe flexes before you launch.

## 🔵 5-Minute **Post-Paddle Cooldown**

Goal: release the static tension in your legs, hips, and lower back that causes that “monster walk.”

### 1. **Standing Quad Stretch (1 min each leg)**

- Hold a tree, car, or fence for balance.
    
- Bring your heel toward your glute, grab your ankle or pant leg, keep knees close together.
    
- You should feel a stretch in the front of the thigh.
    
- Don’t force it — gentle pull is plenty.
    

### 2. **Lunge-Style Hip Flexor Stretch (1 min each side)**

- Step one foot back, drop that knee to the ground or just hover it.
    
- Tuck pelvis slightly, lean gently forward.
    
- You’ll feel it in the front of the hip — that’s the muscle that gets tight from sitting in the cockpit.
    

### 3. **Seated Hamstring Stretch (1 min)**

- Sit on a bench or dock edge.
    
- Extend one leg straight, reach gently toward your toes with a flat back.
    
- Light stretch behind the thigh, not pain.
    

### 4. **Glute / Piriformis Stretch (1 min)**

- Sit cross-legged or in a chair.
    
- Cross your right ankle over your left knee.
    
- Gently lean forward until you feel stretch in your outer hip.
    
- Switch sides.
    

### 5. **Torso / Spine Twist (1 min)**

- Sit tall, cross one leg over the other, and twist gently toward the top leg.
    
- Breathe deeply — this resets your lower-back alignment after sitting in the kayak seat.

## ⚙️ Optional Add-Ons (2–3× per week)

To strengthen the same muscles for easier entries/exits:

- **Bridges** (lying on back, lift hips) – strengthens glutes and core.
    
- **Wall sits** – builds endurance in quads for better cockpit control.
    
- **Cat-cow or gentle yoga flow** – keeps spine mobile.
